A simple creature addition for CDDA for added verisimilitude. 
While I believe everything herein is handled tastefully, that may not hold true for what players do with its contents.
This mod is standalone to avoid associating it with any development branch or repository.

The mod currently adds three new monsters:
1.Absent Adolescent - child civilian variant
2.Careless Child - child civilian variant
3.Feral Child - child variant of the typical Feral Human
