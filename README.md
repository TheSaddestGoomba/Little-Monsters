A simple creature addition for CDDA for added verisimilitude.<br>
While I believe everything herein is handled tastefully, that may not hold true for what players do with its contents.<br>
This mod is standalone to avoid associating it with any development branch or repository.<br>

The mod currently adds three new monsters:<br>
 1.Absent Adolescent - child civilian variant<br>
 2.Careless Child - child civilian variant<br>
 3.Feral Child - child variant of the typical Feral Human<br>
